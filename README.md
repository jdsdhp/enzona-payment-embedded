The Enzona Payment Embedded is a lightweight Kotlin library designed to simplify integration with
the Enzona payment system in Android applications. This library is built on top of several
foundational libraries, including:

- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson): A library for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp): An HTTP client for making network requests.
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines): A library for asynchronous
  programming in Kotlin using coroutines.

## Documentation

The development of this library was guided by
the [official Enzona API documentation](https://api.enzona.net/store/apis/info?name=PaymentAPI&version=v1.0.0&provider=admin),
which provides comprehensive information about the Enzona Payment API.

## Including in your project

#### Gradle

```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
		repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
		repositories {
			mavenCentral()
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.jdsdhp:enzona-payment-embedded:v0.1.0'
}
```

## Usage

### 1. Initialization

Initialize the Enzona Payment Embedded in your application by calling the `initialize` method.
Provide the appropriate values for the API URL, merchant consumer key, consumer secret, and merchant
UUID.

```kotlin
Enzona.getInstance().initialize(
    apiUrl = Enzona.ApiUrl.OFFICIAL,
    merchantConsumerKey = "your_consumer_key",
    merchantConsumerSecret = "your_consumer_secret",
    merchantUUID = "your_merchant_uuid",
)
```

> Note: The authentication step is optional and only required if you want to validate the data
> during initialization.

### 2. Authentication (Optional)

Authenticate using Enzona credentials by calling the `authenticate` method. This step is
particularly useful if you want to verify the validity of the provided merchant credentials.

```kotlin
val authenticationResult: ResultValue<Token> = Enzona.getInstance().authenticate()
```

> Note: Handling authentication errors is crucial for ensuring a secure integration.

### 3. Creating a Payment

Create a payment using the `createPayment` method. Provide details such
as `discount`, `shipping`, `tip` and other necessary parameters.

```kotlin
val paymentResult: ResultValue<Payment> = Enzona.getInstance().createPayment(
    discount = 10.0,
    shipping = 5.0,
    tip = 2.0,
    // ... other parameters
    items = listOf(item1, item2, item3)
)
```

### 4. Getting Payment Details

Retrieve payment details using the `getPaymentDetails` method with the `transaction_uuid`.

```kotlin
val paymentResult: ResultValue<Payment> = Enzona.getInstance().getPaymentDetails("transaction_uuid")
```

### 5.Cancelling a Payment

Cancel a payment using the `cancelPayment` method with the`transaction_uuid`.

```kotlin
val paymentResult: ResultValue<Payment> = Enzona.getInstance().getPaymentDetails("transaction_uuid")
```

### 5.Completing a Payment

Complete a payment using the `completePayment` method with the`transaction_uuid`.

```kotlin
val completeResult: ResultValue<Payment> = Enzona.getInstance().completePayment("transaction_uuid")
```

---
**Note: Ensure that you handle the asynchronous nature of some functions appropriately, as indicated
by the use of suspend in function signatures.**
